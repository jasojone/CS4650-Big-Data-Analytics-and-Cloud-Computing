# Course Description

This course covers the concepts and technologies involved in big data analytics and cloud computing. Students will learn about managing, analyzing, and interpreting large and complex data sets, as well as the foundations and characteristics of cloud computing and its infrastructure mechanisms. Students will also learn how to design and implement projects related to big data analytics and cloud computing.

# Professor

Dr. J (dljohannsen@cpp.edu)

# Class Format

This is an in-person class with a backup Zoom/recording option. If the school shuts down in-person classes, the course will pivot to online. Attendance is encouraged during in-person lectures because of the frequent in-class exercises that require group discussions. Questions are also encouraged during lectures.
