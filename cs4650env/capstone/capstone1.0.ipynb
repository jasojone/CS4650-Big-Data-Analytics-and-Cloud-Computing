    "# Capstone Project Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capstone Project is a group project, which will be used in place of a Final Exam. Here are the guidelines for the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Team Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Form teams of 3-4 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign into Kaggle and select a dataset/competition that interests your team. There are many types of projects, some covering machine learning topics that we did not cover in class. However, you should be able to find projects in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map/Reduce\n",
    "2. Linear Regression\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "4. Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to choose one of these, you can branch out if you want. Download the data from Kaggle. If you are using data from one of the competitions, sign up for the competition, download the data (then solve the problem and submit your results!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the suggested analysis, then report on your work. Describe the approach you took and the steps you took to clean the data, improve the results, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Report your results and visualize them using different graphs/charts/views to highlight your conclusions. Compare your results with other submissions to Kaggle, if that information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize what worked well and what did not work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit a report indicating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who is on your team\n",
    "2. Which dataset/competition you chose\n",
    "3. What approach you took. What steps did you take to clean the data, improve the results, etc.\n",
    "4. What are your results. How did you choose to visualize the results (perhaps show different graphs/charts/views to highlight your conclusions)\n",
    "5. How did your results compare (if that information is available)\n",
    "6. What worked well, what not so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a group project, only one submission is needed for the group. Based on the list of names, the score will be copied to everyone in the group.\n"
