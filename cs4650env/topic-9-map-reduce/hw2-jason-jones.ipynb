    "The Data\n",
    "There is a data file that needs to be analyzed by a Map/Reduce system.  The file's name is 'cs4650hw2.dat', and it is available on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data represents a 2 dimensional array of cells, and there are several values in each cell.  The basic task is this: for each row in the array, examine all of the values in all of the cells of that row, returning the smallest value found.  At the same time, for each column in the array, examine all of the values in all of the cells in that column, returning the largest value found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the details:\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are labeled 'A' through 'J', so there are 10 columns.\n",
    "The rows are labeled 'K' through 'T', so there are 10 rows.\n",
    "The values are integers from 0 to 999.\n",
    "The data file uses CSV format, with each line of the file giving the column name, the row name, and one of the values for that cell.  For example, some of the lines of the file might be:\n",

    "Then solve each of the three following assignment.\n",
    "Important: Do not clear the outputs before submitting the assignment -- keep all of the values there, so that I don't necessarily have to run your notebook, I can just see the results.  If I want to run the notebook I can.  If you do clear the outputs so that I am forced to rerun your notebook, then you lose 10% on the grade.\n",
